I strongly support net neutrality backed by Title 2 oversight of ISPs. Ending net neutrality infringes on our natural rights of freedom of speech and assembly. I am a human that enjoys basic human rights with freedom of information being one of them. I strongly oppose having the ISP oligopoly imposing their will and charging citizens extra money for their god-awful fees that they do not need for what would be labeled as ‘premium content’. Ajit Pai does not know what the people want, he is only interested in his own greed. He has a goofy smile too that will never be accepted by the public.
